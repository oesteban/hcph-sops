import fnmatch


def heur(physinfo, take=""):
    """
    Set of if .. elif statements to fill BIDS names.

    It requires the user (you!) to adjust it accordingly!
    It needs an ``if`` or ``elif`` statement for each file that
    needs to be processed.
    The statement will test if the ``physinfo``:
        - is similar to a string (first case), or
        - exactly matches a string (second case).

    Parameters
    ----------
    physinfo: str
        Name of an input file that should be bidsified (See Notes)

    Returns
    -------
    info: dictionary of str
        Dictionary containing BIDS keys

    Notes
    -----
    The `if ..` structure should always be similar to::

        if physinfo == 'somepattern':
            info['var'] = 'somethingelse'

    or, in case it's a partial match::

        if fnmatch.fnmatchcase(physinfo, '*somepattern?'):
            info['var'] = 'somethingelse'

    where:
    
    - ``physinfo`` and ``info`` are dedicated keywords,
    - ``'somepattern'`` is the name of the file,
    - ``'var'`` is a BIDS key in the list below
    - ``'somethingelse'`` is the value of the key
