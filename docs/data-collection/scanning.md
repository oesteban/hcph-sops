    You MUST know the security procedures in case of problem and keep yourself updated with changes.
    Some of the emergency procedures are found [here](emergency-procedures.md).

    In addition to the brief guidelines given in these SOPs, further safety information is found in {{ secrets.tribu.mri_security | default("███") }}.

## Before initiating the session

??? warning "Double check the protocol with the correct phase-encoding direction was selected"

    For conveniency, this is the session schedule (<mark>today is {{ now() }}</mark>):

{% filter indent(width=4) %}
{% include 'code/sessions/schedule.md' %}
{% endfilter %}

!!! warning "Report all observations in the session notes"
    It is easy to forget details about particular sessions, especially when so many sessions are acquired. 
    They can however be very informative for quality control of your data or understand idiosyncrasies, so it is important to keep track of them.
    As such, please note any observation in the issue dedicated to collecting session notes that you should have opened in [the preparation of the session](pre-session.md#documentation-and-other-non-experimental-devices).

## During the session

- [ ] Check in with the participant frequently, not necessarily only at the scripted points.
- [ ] Watch for motion and arousal state using the ET's camera.
      If you detect motion or the participant falls asleep at inadequate points, use the speaker to inform them.

## Check experimental setup

!!! danger "DO NOT FORGET to check the readiness of the experimental setup at this point"

### Check the syncbox

- [ ] the box is on,
- [ ] *Synchronization mode* is on,
- [ ] session has been started,
- [ ] volume count is reset to 0 out of 9999,
- [ ] USB cable to *{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}* is connected.
- [ ] Check the corresponding box in the issue collecting notes about the session.

### Check the eye-tracker

- [ ] The ET computer is turned on (switch it on if necessary),
- [ ] The pupil is correctly detected (as described [here](participant-prep.md#final-preparatory-steps-of-the-et))
- [ ] Check the corresponding box in the issue collecting notes about the session.

### Check *{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}*:

- [ ] has enough battery, and plug the power cord if necessary;
- [ ] USB cable to the MMBT-S Trigger Interface Box is connected;
- [ ] serial cable from the MMBT-S Trigger Interface Box is connected to the back of the SPT100D digital interface (gray block) of the BIOPAC;
- [ ] computer is ready, with psychopy open, and with the appropriate version of experiments; and
- [ ] leave the computer with a pleasant screen projecting (e.g., a gray background).
- [ ] Check the corresponding box in the issue collecting notes about the session.

??? danger "Make sure to load the correct environment"

    - [ ] Deactivate conda (if active):
        ``` shell
        conda deactivate
        ```
    - [ ] Load the new virtual environment:
        ``` shell
        source $HOME/psychopyenv/bin/activate
        ```

### Check *{{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}*:

- [ ] has enough battery, and plug the power cord if necessary;
- [ ] computer is ready, with the *AcqKnowledge* software open and collecting data;
- [ ] check the ECG and RB signals, and fix unanticipated problems (e.g., the respiration belt needs to be fastened tighter);
- [ ] the *Amphetamine* app is running and keeping the computer unlocked while *AcqKnowledge* is working.
- [ ] Check the corresponding box in the issue collecting notes about the session.

!!! warning "When running multiple sessions back-to-back"

        - [ ] Restart a new session of the syncbox (within one session we usually see 9,000+, and the maximum is 9,999):
            - [ ] Press the central button :fontawesome-solid-circle:{ .bluecolor } to stop the session,
            - [ ] use the up :fontawesome-solid-caret-up:{ .bluecolor } and down :fontawesome-solid-caret-down:{ .bluecolor } arrows to find and select the option <span class="syncbox">Start Session</span> and hit enter :fontawesome-solid-circle:{ .bluecolor },
            - [ ] Press the central button :fontawesome-solid-circle:{ .bluecolor } again to start the new session.
        - [ ] In *AcqKnowledge*, make sure you stopped the previous recording and started a new one (it will ask for a re-calibration of the respiration belt).
        - [ ] Start a *New examination* on the MR console:
            - [ ] Make sure all acquisitions are done,
            - [ ] close any open patient window,
            - [ ] find the patient in the system (or write new information for a new participant)
            - [ ] right click on the patient and press `start new examination`.

## Ensuring the quality of physiological signals

It is critical to check that physiological signals are looking good:

* Before starting the session, and
* from time to time within the session.

|:--:|
| ***Examples of good and problematic RB and CO<sub>2</sub> signals.*** *Following these guidelines, our physiological signals should resemble the cases labeled as "good" above.* |

!!! thanks "Thanks to César Caballero-Gaudés, Stefano Moia, Kristina Zvolankek, Elenor Morgenroth for the slide above<sup>[1]</sup>."

### Checking the RB

!!! warning "To ensure the best RB signal"
    Calibrate the RB with the tube **unplugged** while the participant is **in** the scanner (you may have to help the participant).
    Then, ask (and/or help) the participant to plug it back.

- [ ] The RB signal SHOULD NOT plateau (neither saturate at a peak value nor floor at the troughs).
    This means the RB is maxing out and it requires loosening.
- [ ] The envelope of your signal SHOULD remain approximately constant.
    If peaks drop or troughs rise, it might be a sign that the RB is too loose.
    Go back into the scanning room and tighten the RB.
- [ ] Check the corresponding box in the issue collecting notes about the session.

### Checking the CO<sub>2</sub> signal

- [ ] The period of the CO<sub>2</sub> signal should remain constant.
    If it varies, the vacuum MAY be too low:

    - [ ] Check that the nasal cannula is correctly placed in the participant's nostrils.
    - [ ] Check that all the extension connections of the tube are air-tight
    - [ ] Check that the tube is not hanging at any point.

- [ ] The envelope of your signal SHOULD remain approximately constant.
    If the peaks diminish, it might be a sign that the participant is breathing through their mouth.
    In such a case, remind the participant to breathe through their nose.

    ???+ quote "Remind the participant they MUST breathe through their nose at all times"
        Hey [NAME],

        Is everything okay?

        I needed to ask you whether you are breathing through your nose because we are not recording sensible levels of CO<sub>2</sub>.

        [WAIT FOR THEIR RESPONSE]

        Thank you.

- [ ] Check the corresponding box in the issue collecting notes about the session.

### Checking the ECG signal

- [ ] The period and the envelope of the signal should remain constant.
- [ ] [We are placing the ECG electrodes in lead-1 mode](participant-prep.md#connecting-physiological-recording-sensors-and-probes), which should give an ECG signal that looks vaguely like the familiar QRS shape (see below).
    Typically, the signal does not look as neat as on the schema because the magnetic fields of the MR interfere with the electrodes (even if they are MR-compatible electrodes).

## Acquire a localizer (*AAhead_scout*)
- [ ] Indicate the participant that the scanning will soon start:

    ???+ quote "Tell the participant that we are starting"
        Hey [NAME], we are about to start our first scan run.

        This is going to be a long session, so please make sure you are feeling as comfortable as you possibly can in there.
        Remember not to cross your legs or hold your hands together and check your back is also comfortable.
        I'm going to ask you to take a deep breath now, so I can check the respiration belt is properly set up.
        If it is too tight, please let me know.

        [Allow a few moments for the participant to breathe while you check the recordings]

        Okay, we seem to be able to track your respiration. Is the respiration belt too restraining?
        This is also a good moment to swallow, and to check your neck and head are in a comfortable position.

        For this first part, all you have to do is stay still; you can relax and close your eyes if it helps.

        Are you ready?

- [ ] Wait for the participant confirmation and set the speaker off afterward.
- [ ] Launch the `AAhead_scout_64ch-head-coil` protocol by pressing *Continue* :fontawesome-solid-play:{ .redcolor }.

        You can close your eyes and even sleep if you wish.

        I'm going to give you a short time (ten seconds or so) to swallow, and perhaps accommodate your back or your arms. However, please try not to move your head.

        It is critical that you don't move, especially at all at the very beginning and the next 20 seconds after you hear the first blipping sounds.

        Try to minimize swallowing and eye movements (for example, blinking) and maintain comfortable and shallow breathing.
        Remember to breathe through your nose, not through your mouth, so the expired CO<sub>2</sub> can be measured with the cannula.

            ```
        - [ ] Load the new virtual environment:
            ``` shell
            source $HOME/psychopyenv/bin/activate
            ```

    ``` shell
    cd ~/workspace/HCPh-fMRI-tasks
    python {{ settings.psychopy.tasks.func_bht }}.py
    ```

    A modal dialog will ask you for the number of trial (automatically calculated, DO NOT modify) and the session number.

    !!! danger "The following steps MUST be executed in this order"

            - [ ] Drag and drop the modal dialog into the scanner's projector screen.
            - [ ] Update the session number with the corresponding number.

- [ ] On the stimuli laptop (*{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}*), check the correct session number is set and hit *OK*.

    ??? danger "The OK button MUST be clicked with this modal dialog on the projector's screen"

        Otherwise, the wrong screen will be selected by *Psychopy*

### Breath-holding task (BHT)
- [ ] Inform the participant:

    ???+ quote "Drift-check ET before continuing"
        Thanks [NAME], that was a long behavioral task.

        Before moving on, we will run another check of the eye tracker, please focus your sight on the fixation point.

        Is everything alright?

- [ ] Wait for confirmation, respond to follow-up comments
- [ ] [Initiate the ET drift correction procedure](scanning-notes.md#eye-tracker-drift).
    **The ET control menu must have appeared after hitting *OK* on the modal dialog**.
    - [ ] Once the ET is *drift-checked* and no calibration is needed, verify that the ET menu is removed and the task program awaits for the sequence's trigger to start.
- [ ] Inform the participant that the next sequence is breath-holding task fMRI.
    Repeat the instructions for the task.

    ???+ quote "Starting the breath-holding task"
        Hey [NAME], we will proceed now with a breath-holding task.

        I remind you that you have to breathe following the cues of the colored rectangle.

        Green means "BREATHE IN", orange means "BREATHE OUT" and red means "HOLD YOUR BREATH".

        Remember to not follow the breathing instructions during the first block and to exhale the small amount of air you have remaining at the end of the hold.

        Are you ready?

- [ ] Launch the `func-bold_task-bht_dir-{RL,LR,PA,AP}__cmrr_me4_sms4` sequence by pressing *Continue* :fontawesome-solid-play:{ .redcolor }.
- [ ] Confirm that the task program starts on *{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}* after the calibration scans.

**While the BHT is running:**

- [ ] Determine whether there is enough time to run the anatomical T2-weighted run.
    If so,
    - [ ] [adjust the FoV](scanning-notes.md#setting-the-fov) for the following sequence; or alternatively
    - [ ] wait for the sequence to complete.

**Once the BHT is concluded:**

- [ ] Wait for the current task program to finish on *{{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}*.

    !!! warning "If you must interrupt the task program, check first that the EDF files have been copied."

- [ ] Check the box confirming that it has been acquired in the issue collecting notes about the session.
    Don't forget to report any observations there.


## Acquire a T2w image (if time permits)

- [ ] Launch the `anat-T2w__flair` protocol by pressing *Continue* :fontawesome-solid-play:{ .redcolor }, or
- [ ] skip the T<sub>2</sub>-weighted collection.

## Stop physiology collection

!!! warning "The following step MAY be done while the T2w is running."

- [ ] Stop the *AcqKnowledge* recording on the *{{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}* computer.

!!! tip "The following steps MAY be done while the T2w is running IF (and only if) there's no back-to-back session upon conclusion of the current"

    - [ ] Switch the BIOPAC MP160 module off.
    - [ ] Turn off the pump of the GA.
    - [ ] Switch the GA off.
    - [ ] Put the exhaust and inlet caps back.

## Concluding the session

- [ ] Inform the participant:

    ???+ quote "Session is finished"
        Thanks [NAME], the session has concluded and we will shortly let you out of the scanner.

## Session completed

The exam is over, you can proceed with the [tear-down protocol](./tear-down.md).
